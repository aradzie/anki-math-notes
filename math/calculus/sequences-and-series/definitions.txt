What is an infinite sequence?
---
An infinite sequence is an ordered and indexed list of numbers of the form

\[ a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n, \ldots \]

Each number \(a_n\) is a term of the sequence.
The subscript \(n\) is the index variable of the sequence.

Sequences can be defined in various ways:

- Listing terms: For instance, \(\{ 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \}\).
- Explicit formula: A formula that defines the n-th term directly in terms of n, \(a_n = f(n)\).
- Recurrence relation: A rule that defines a term based on previous terms in the sequence, \(a_n = f(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \ldots)\).

What is the limit of a sequence?
---
A real number \(L\) is called the limit of a sequence \(\{a_n\}\) if, for every positive real number \(\epsilon\), there exists a natural number \(N\) such that for all \(n > N\), the absolute difference between \(a_n\) and \(L\) is less than \(\epsilon\):

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L \]

If such a finite value \(L\) exists, the sequence is said to **converge** to that limit.

If the terms of the sequence do not approach a single finite value (e.g., they grow infinitely large or oscillate without settling), then the sequence is said to **diverge**.

What is the squeeze theorem for sequences?
---
Consider sequences \(\{a_n\}\), \(\{b_n\}\), and \(\{c_n\}\).
Suppose there exists an integer \(N\) such that \(a_n \le b_n \le c_n\) for all \(n \ge N\).

If there exists a real number \(L\) such that

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L = \lim_{n \to \infty} c_n, \]

then \(\{b_n\}\) converges and

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = L \]
===

What is the monotone convergence theorem?
---
If \(\{a_n\}\) is a bounded sequence and there exists a positive integer \(n_0\) such that \(\{a_n\}\) is monotone for all \(n \ge n_0\), then \(\{a_n\}\) converges.
===

What is an infinite series?
---
An infinite series is a sum of the terms of an infinite sequnce \(a_n\)

\[ S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots \]
===

What is the harmonic series?
---
The harmonic series is an infinite series of the following form

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \]

The harmonic series diverges to infinity.

The harmonic series is a special case of the p-series with \(p = 1\).
===

What is the geometric series?
---
The geometric series is an infinite series of the following form

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a r^{n-1} = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \ldots \]

The geometric series converges to

\[ \frac{a}{1-r} \]

if \(|r| < 1\).
===

What is the p-series?
---
The p-series series is an infinite series of the following form

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p} = \frac{1}{1^p} + \frac{1}{2^p} + \frac{1}{3^p} + \ldots \]

The p-series converges if \(p > 1\).

The p-series diverges if \(p \le 1\).
===

What is the divergence test for a series?
---
Consider the sequence \(a_n\). If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \neq 0\) or \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n\) does not exist, then the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) diverges.

The converse is not true. That is, if \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0\), we cannot make any conclusion about the convergence of \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\).
===

What is the integral test?
---
Suppose \(\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n\) is a series with positive terms \(a_n\). Suppose there exists a function \(f\) and a positive integer \(N\) such that the following three conditions are satisfied:

- \(f\) is continuous,
- \(f\) is decreasing, and
- \(f(n) = a_n\) for all integers \(n \ge N\).

Then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) and \(\int_{N}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx\) both converge or both diverge.

Although convergence of the integral implies convergence of the related series, it does not imply that the value of the integral and the series are the same.

What is the direct comparison test?
---
Suppose there exists an integer \(N\) such that \(0 \le a_n \le b_n\) for all \(n \ge N\). If \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) converges, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) converges.

Suppose there exists an integer \(N\) such that \(a_n \ge b_n \ge 0\) for all \(n \ge N\). If \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) diverges, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) diverges.
===

What is the limit comparison test?
---
Let \(a_n\), \(b_n \ge 0\) for all \(n \ge 1\).

If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n/b_n = L \ne 0\), then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) and \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) both converge or both diverge.

If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n/b_n = 0\) and \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) converges, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) converges.

If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n/b_n = \infty\) and \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n\) diverges, then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) diverges.
===

What is the alternating series?
---
The alternating series is a sum of the terms of an infinite sequnce \(a_n\) whose terms alternate between positive and negative values:

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n+1} a_n = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - \ldots \]

or

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n} a_n = - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + \ldots \]
===

What is the alternating series test?
---
An alternating series of the form \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n+1} \ a_n\) or \(
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n} \ a_n\) converges if \(0 < a_{n+1} \le a_n\) for all \(n \ge 1\) and \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0\).

What is the ratio test?
---
Consider the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) with nonzero terms. Let

\[ \rho = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| \]

- If \(0 \le \rho < 1\), then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) converges absolutely.
- If \(\rho > 1\) or \(\rho = \infty\), then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) diverges.
- If \(\rho = 1\), the test does not provide any information.
===

What is the root test?
---
Consider the series \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\). Let

\[ \rho = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|} \]

- If \(0 \le \rho < 1\), then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) converges absolutely.
- If \(\rho > 1\) or \(\rho = \infty\), then \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\) diverges.
- If \(\rho = 1\), the test does not provide any information.
===

What is the power series?
---
The power series is an infinite series of the following form

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n x^n = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \ldots \]

where \(x\) is a variable and the coefficients \(c_n\) are constants.
