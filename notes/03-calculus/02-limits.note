!front: What is a continuous function?
!back:
A function \( f(x) \) is **continuous at a point** \( x = c \) if:

- \( f(c) \) exists: The function is defined at the point \( c \).
- \( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) \) exists: The limit of the function as \( x \) approaches \( c \) from both the left and right sides is the same.
- \( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c) \): The limit of the function as \( x \) approaches \( c \) is equal to the actual value of the function at \( c \).

If a function is continuous at every point in its domain, it is called a **continuous** function.
